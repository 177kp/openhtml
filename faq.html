    <h1>FAQ</h1>
    
    <h2>I didn't insert the JavaScript and it still runs</h2>
    <p>When you tab to the <em>output</em> panel, JS Bin <em>automatically</em> inserts your JavaScript on the fly, so you don't need to worry about it.</p>

    
    <h2>I need my JavaScript inserted in a specific position</h2>
    <p>The <em>special %code%</em> symbol will be replaced with your JavaScript. If it's not included, it will be included just before the body closes. Otherwise you can add <em>&lt;script&gt;%code%&lt;/script&gt;</em> anywhere you like.</p>
    
    <h2>How do I re-run the code</h2>

    <p>Just <em>click the 'Output'</em> tab, and the entire frame will re-execute.</p>
    
    <h2>Can I see the output outside of this window?</h2>
    <p>Yes. First you must save the code, then <em>use the 'Live' link</em>. This is now stored privately and can be shared amongst your peers.</p>
    
    <h2>When I click the live link it doesn't reflect my changes</h2>

    <p>The live link <em>only shows the saved</em> code, any changes must be saved first.</p>

    <h2>Can JS Bin respond to Ajax requests?</h2>
    <p>Yes. See the <a class="tab" href="#video">video introduction</a> for a demo. Or, it's as simple as removing the HTML output, saving the code, then requesting the URL via a new snippet.  JS Bin will respond to Ajax requests appropriately.</p>
    
    <h2>Is there a bookmarklet?</h2>

    <p>Funny you ask! Yes, just drag the following <a href="javascript:(function(){window.location='http://jsbin.com/?js='+encodeURIComponent((window.getSelection?window.getSelection():document.selection.createRange().text)+'')})()">jsbin</a> bookmarklet to your bookmark bar. The bookmarklet will inject any selected JavaScript in to JS Bin.</p>
    
    <h2>IE6?</h2>
    <p>Sorry: <em>no</em>.</p>
    
    <h2>My question isn't answered</h2>

    <p>Feel free to <a href="http://leftlogic.com/contact?message=Question%20regarding%20JS Bin:%20">get in touch</a> and if appropriate I'll add it to the FAQ.</p>
