    <ul>
    <li>Click on the HTML or JavaScript labels to hide the JavaScript panel (this is stored to your preferences).</li>
    <li>To only show the HTML panel use #html on the end of the url, such as http://jsbin.com/#html</li>
    <li>&#8220;Use as my template&#8221; stores the current code as the default code you see when you open a new JS Bin window.</li>
    <li>Refreshing the window will not lose your changes.</li>
    <li>Use <code>console.log</code> to display debug information. If Firebug is present, then the logging goes there, otherwise it will show in a custom console window.</li>
    <li>To view only the JavaScript append <code>/js</code> to the url, i.e. http://jsbin.com/ujayi/js</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

    <ul>
    <li>When I change the url to a different JS Bin, it still has the old code</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Click the <strong>revert</strong> button and it will reload the code from the database based on the url you requested.</p>

    <ul>
    <li>I didn&#8217;t insert the JavaScript and it still runs</li>
    </ul>

    <p>When you tab to the output panel, JS Bin automatically inserts your JavaScript on the fly, so you don&#8217;t need to worry about it.</p>

    <ul>
    <li>I need my JavaScript inserted in a specific position</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Either insert the JavaScript directly in to the HTML panel, or you can use the special <code>%code%</code> command.  Add <code>&lt;script&gt;%code%&lt;/script&gt;</code> to your HTML and the contents of the JavaScript panel will be inserted at that point.</p>

    <ul>
    <li>How do I re-run or re-render the code</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Just click the &#8216;Preview&#8217; button, and your entire code will re-run.</p>

    <ul>
    <li>Can JS Bin respond to Ajax requests?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Yes. See the Ajax debugging video (in the top of the navigation) for a demo. Or, it&#8217;s as simple as removing the HTML output, saving the code, then requesting the URL via a new snippet. JS Bin will respond to Ajax requests appropriately.</p>

    <ul>
    <li>IE6?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I&#8217;m afraid not, but the application is open source, so if you think you can get it working - please go ahead: <a href="http://github.com/remy/jsbin">http://github.com/remy/jsbin</a></p>

    <ul>
    <li>My question isn&#8217;t answered</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Feel free to get in touch and if appropriate I&#8217;ll add it to the FAQ.</p>
